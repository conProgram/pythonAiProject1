This Project is a AI learning to play the mobile game Flappy Bird to perfection using Python.

In this project I made the game slightly harder for the computer by reducing the size of the gaps between pipes from the orginal game.

The AI works by trying random combinations of movements to learn which is the best to survive the longest, each time a generation passes
more birds are born using similar characteristics to the most efficient birds from the previous generation. This eventually creates a generation of 
perfect birds who never die.

There are 100 birds at the start of every generation.
